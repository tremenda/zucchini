                    <h4 class="accordion-toggle">What makes this technique better than others? <span class="fa fa-plus"></span></h4>
                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p><strong>1. Work with time, not against it:</strong> For many people, time is an enemy. We race against the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro Technique teaches you to work with time, instead of struggling against it. A revolutionary time management system, it is at once deceptively simple to learn and life-changing to use.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Eliminate Burnout:</strong> Essential to the Pomodoro Technique is the notion that taking short, scheduled breaks while working eliminates the “running on fumes” feeling you get when you’ve pushed yourself too hard. It’s impossible to over work when you stick to the system. You may end up taking fewer sick days, too!</p>
                            <p><strong>3.Manage Distractions:</strong> Whether it’s a call, a Facebook message, or suddenly realizing you need to change the oil in your car, many distracting thoughts and events come up when you’re at work. The Pomodoro Technique will help you log your distractions and order them according to priority levels. Often, they can wait.</p>
                            <p><strong>4.Create a better work-life balance:</strong> Most of us are intimately acquainted with the guilt that comes from procrastinating. If we haven’t had a productive day, it’s pretty easy to end up feeling like we can’t enjoy our free time. Becoming a Pomodoro Master involves creating an effective timetable, allowing you to truly enjoy your time off.</p>

                    <h4 class="accordion-toggle">How do I use it? <span class="fa fa-plus"></span></h4>
                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p><strong>1. Choose a task you'd like to get done:</strong> Something big, something small, something you’ve been putting off for a million years: it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s something that deserves your full, undivided attention.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Set the timer:</strong> Make a small oath to yourself: I will spend 25 minutes on this task and I will not interrupt myself. You can do it! After all, it’s just 25 minutes.</p>
                            <p><strong>3.Work on the task until timer rings:</strong> Immerse yourself in the task for the next 25 minutes. If you suddenly realize you have something else you need to do, write the task down on a sheet of paper.</p>
                            <p><strong>4.Checkmark:</strong> Congratulations! You’ve spent an entire, interruption-less Pomodoro on a task.</p>
                            <p><strong>5. Take a short break:</strong> Breathe, meditate, grab a cup of coffee, go for a short walk or do something else relaxing (i.e., not work-related). Your brain will thank you later.</p>
                            <p><strong>6. Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break:</strong> Once you’ve completed four pomodoros, you can take a longer break. 20 minutes is good. Or 30. Your brain will use this time to assimilate new information and rest before the next round of Pomodoros.</p>

                        <h4 class="accordion-toggle">How this technique will change you <span class="fa fa-plus"></span></h4>
                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p><strong>1. Find out how much effort an activity requires:</strong> Ever wonder where all your time goes? Wonder no more: it’s all on the page. Your Pomodoro To-Do sheet is a visual overview of the time you’ve spent on various tasks.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Cut down on interrruptions:</strong> Usually, you can afford to take 25 minutes before calling back a friend or replying to an email. You’ll learn how to handle the inevitable interruption while staying focused on the task at hand.</p>
                            <p><strong>3.Estimate the effort for activities:</strong> Once you’ve gotten the hang of the technique, you’ll be able to accurately predict how many Pomodoros it will take to accomplish tomorrow’s -- or next month’s -- tasks.</p>
